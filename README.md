## In memoriam

## About us

- The Rosdolsky Research Project was launched by the **[Rosdolsky Circle Vienna](https://rosdolsky.org)**.
- We are building a research portal on revolutionary theory & practice in the 20th century, dedicated to the lives and works of two deserving labor activists.
- In 2008 we started to establish our reading & study circle in Vienna.
- In 2015 our research group inspected the Roman Rosdolsky Papers at the IISH in Amsterdam.
- In May 2017 we published the first extensive biography: **[Mit permanenten Gr√º√üen](http://www.mandelbaum.at/buch.php?id=751)**

Our website was created by **[Stefanie Klamuth](https://github.com/kaputtzig)**
and by **[Pablo H√∂rtner](https://github.com/redtux)** in July 2017
on the occasion of Roman Rosdolsky's 119th birthday.

Through reconstruction of the works and lives of Emmy and Roman Rosdolsky,

and Red Vienna intellectuals, and their intense debates with important Marxist

and b) emphasize the ongoing relevance of Historical Materialism in the 21st century.
